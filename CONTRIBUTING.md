## Pull Requests

- **PSR-12 Coding Standard** - Check the code style with `composer check-style` and fix it with `composer fix-style`.
- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

## Running Tests

```bash
composer test
```

**Happy coding**!
